TLS is a protocol for protecting communications between the browser and the target server. When the browser attempts to set up a protected communication with the target server, the browser and server negotiate which protocol and version to use. The browser and server attempt to match each other's list of supported protocols and versions and pick the most preferred match.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000514, SRG-APP-000555, SRG-APP-000625, SRG-APP-000630, SRG-APP-000635","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":["SV-59337","V-46473"],"ccis":["CCI-002450"],"reference_identifier":"4095","uuid":"412d55f2-72c5-477b-9009-6303099715e6","stig_uuid":"369b9c03-2b5b-401f-a697-fc373627fc88","status":"not_a_finding","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2401.3 (Scan-IE11_Checks) found this to be NOT A FINDING on 03/21/2024:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n'Turn off Encryption Support' is Enabled: (Use TLS1.1, Use TLS 1.2)\r\n\r\nRegistry Path:\tHKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\r\nValue Name:\tSecureProtocols\r\nValue:\t\t0x00000800 (2048)\r\nType:\t\tREG_DWORD\r\n"},{"group_id_src":"V-250541","group_tree":[{"id":"V-250541","title":"SRG-APP-000416","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-250541","severity":"medium","group_title":"Allow Fallback to SSL 3.0 (Internet Explorer) must be disabled.","rule_id_src":"SV-250541r942485_rule","rule_id":"SV-250541r942485","rule_version":"DTBI1100-IE11","rule_title":"Allow Fallback to SSL 3.0 (Internet Explorer) must be disabled.","fix_text":"Set the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> Windows Components >> Internet Explorer >> Security Features >> \"Allow fallback to SSL 3.0 (Internet Explorer)\" to \"Enabled\", and select \"No Sites\" from the drop-down box.\n","weight":"10.0","check_content":"The policy value for Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> Windows Components >> Internet Explorer >> Security Features >> \"Allow fallback to SSL 3.0 (Internet Explorer)\" must be \"Enabled\", and \"No Sites\" selected from the drop-down box.

Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.\n\nOrganization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).\n\nThis requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality, will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means the time period used must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may depend on the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":[""],"ccis":["CCI-002605"],"reference_identifier":"4095","uuid":"6c982739-2928-4177-b36f-e5056b2ea77c","stig_uuid":"369b9c03-2b5b-401f-a697-fc373627fc88","status":"not_a_finding","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2401.3 (Scan-IE11_Checks) found this to be NOT A FINDING on 03/21/2024:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nInternet Explorer is supported on Microsoft Windows Server 2022 Standard\r\n\r\n\r\nReference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/faq/internet-explorer-microsoft-edge\r\n"}]}],"active":false,"mode":1,"has_path":true,"target_data":{"target_type":"Computing","host_name":"SOT-WIN2K22-WEB","ip_address":"192.168.40.167","mac_address":"00:50:56:36:0D:06","fqdn":"sot-win2k22-web.workgroup","comments":"","role":"None","is_web_database":false,"technology_area":"None","web_db_site":"","web_db_instance":""},"cklb_version":"1.0"}
