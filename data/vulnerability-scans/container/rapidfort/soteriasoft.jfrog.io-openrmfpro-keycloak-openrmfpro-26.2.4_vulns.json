        "Title": "Netty affected by MadeYouReset HTTP/2 DDoS vulnerability",
        "Description": "Below is a technical explanation of a newly discovered vulnerability in HTTP/2, which we refer to as “MadeYouReset.”\n\n### MadeYouReset Vulnerability Summary\nThe MadeYouReset DDoS vulnerability is a logical vulnerability in the HTTP/2 protocol, that uses malformed HTTP/2 control frames in order to break the max concurrent streams limit - which results in resource exhaustion and distributed denial of service.\n\n### Mechanism\nThe vulnerability uses malformed HTTP/2 control frames, or malformed flow, in order to make the server reset streams created by the client (using the RST_STREAM frame). \nThe vulnerability could be triggered by several primitives, defined by the RFC of HTTP/2 (RFC 9113). The Primitives are:\n1. WINDOW_UPDATE frame with an increment of 0 or an increment that makes the window exceed 2^31 - 1. (section 6.9 + 6.9.1)\n2. HEADERS or DATA frames sent on a half-closed (remote) stream (which was closed using the END_STREAM flag). (note that for some implementations it's possible a CONTINUATION frame to trigger that as well - but it's very rare). (Section 5.1)\n3. PRIORITY frame with a length other than 5. (section 6.3)\nFrom our experience, the primitives are likely to exist in the decreasing order listed above.\nNote that based on the implementation of the library, other primitives (which are not defined by the RFC) might exist - meaning scenarios in which RST_STREAM is not supposed to be sent, but in the implementation it does. On the other hand - some RFC-defined primitives might not work, even though they are defined by the RFC (as some implementations are not fully complying with RFC). For example, some implementations we’ve seen discard the PRIORITY frame - and thus does not return RST_STREAM, and some implementations send GO_AWAY when receiving a WINDOW_UPDATE frame with increment of 0.\n\nThe vulnerability takes advantage of a design flaw in the HTTP/2 protocol - While HTTP/2 has a limit on the number of concurrently active streams per connection (which is usually 100, and is set by the parameter SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS), the number of active streams is not counted correctly - when a stream is reset, it is immediately considered not active, and thus unaccounted for in the active streams counter. \nWhile the protocol does not count those streams as active, the server’s backend logic still processes and handles the requests that were canceled.\n\nThus, the attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause the server to handle an unbounded number of concurrent streams from a client on the same connection. The exploitation is very simple: the client issues a request in a stream, and then sends the control frame that causes the server to send a RST_STREAM.\n\n### Attack Flow\nFor example, a possible attack scenario can be: \n1. Attacker opens an HTTP/2 connection to the server.\n2. Attacker sends HEADERS frame with END_STREAM flag on a new stream X.  \n3. Attacker sends WINDOW_UPDATE for stream X with flow-control window of 0.\n4. The server receives the WINDOW_UPDATE and immediately sends RST_STREAM for stream X to the client (+ decreases the active streams counter by 1).\n\nThe attacker can repeat steps 2+3 as rapidly as it is capable, since the active streams counter never exceeds 1 and the attacker does not need to wait for the response from the server.\nThis leads to resource exhaustion and distributed denial of service vulnerabilities with an impact of: CPU overload and/or memory exhaustion (implementation dependent)\n\n### Comparison to Rapid Reset\nThe vulnerability takes advantage of a design flow in the HTTP/2 protocol that was also used in the Rapid Reset vulnerability (CVE-2023-44487) which was exploited as a zero-day in the wild in August 2023 to October 2023, against multiple services and vendors.\nThe Rapid Reset vulnerability uses RST_STREAM frames sent from the client, in order to create an unbounded amount of concurrent streams - it was given a CVSS score of 7.5.\nRapid Reset was mostly mitigated by limiting the number/rate of RST_STREAM sent from the client, which does not mitigate the MadeYouReset attack - since it triggers the server to send a RST_STREAM.\n\n### Suggested Mitigations for MadeYouReset\nA quick and easy mitigation will be to limit the number/rate of RST_STREAMs sent from the server.\nIt is also possible to limit the number/rate of control frames sent by the client (e.g. WINDOW_UPDATE and PRIORITY), and treat protocol flow errors as a connection error.\n\nAs mentioned in our previous message, this is a protocol-level vulnerability that affects multiple vendors and implementations. Given its broad impact, it is the shared responsibility of all parties involved to handle the disclosure process carefully and coordinate mitigations effectively.\n\n\nIf you have any questions, we will be happy to clarify or schedule a Zoom call.\n\nGal, Anat and Yaniv.",

        "Title": "Quarkus potentially leaks data when duplicating a duplicated context",
        "Description": "### Impact\n\nVert.x 4.5.12 has changed the semantics of the duplication of duplicated context.\n\nDuplicated context is an object used to propagate data through a processing (synchronous or asynchronous). Each \"transaction\" or \"processing\" runs on its own isolated duplicated context.\n\nInitially, duplicating a duplicated context was creating a fresh (empty) new context, meaning that the new duplicated context can be used to managed a separated transaction.\n\nIn Vert.x 4.5.12, this semantics has changed, and since the content of the parent duplicated context is copied into the new one, potentially leaking data. \n\nThis CVE is especially for Quarkus as Quarkus extensively uses the Vert.x duplicated context to implement context propagation. With the new semantic data from one transaction can leak to the data from another transaction. From a Vert.x point of view, this new semantic clarifies the behavior. \n\nA significant amount of data is stored in the duplicated context, including request scope, security details, and metadata. Duplicating a duplicated context is rather rare and is only done in a few places:\n\n- Quarkus REST Client when using OTel (but it's the same transaction, so no leak)\n- Quarkus Messaging connectors\n- Quarkus SmallRye Health (same transaction, so no leak)\n\n\n\n### Patches\n\nAfter discussion with the Vert.x team, the change will be rolled back in Vert.x 4.x. A new API will be added to Vert.x 5 do distinguish the 2 cases.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhen duplicating a duplicated context, the following code can be done to avoid the potential leak:\n\n```java\n((ContextInternal) VertxContext.getRootContext(ctx)).duplicate()\n```\n\nThis workaround would not be required once the Vert.x version containing the fix will be included. Note that the workaround would still work. \n\n\n### References\n\nThis issue have been reported in https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/48227.",

        "Title": "Vert.x-Web vulnerable to Stored Cross-site Scripting in directory listings via file names",
        "Description": "# Description\n\n- In the `StaticHandlerImpl#sendDirectoryListing(...)` method under the `text/html` branch, file and directory names are directly embedded into the `href`, `title`, and link text without proper HTML escaping.\n- As a result, in environments where an attacker can control file names, injecting HTML/JavaScript is possible. Simply accessing the directory listing page will trigger an XSS.\n- Affected Code:\n    - File: `vertx-web/src/main/java/io/vertx/ext/web/handler/impl/StaticHandlerImpl.java`\n    - Lines:\n        - 709–713: `normalizedDir` is constructed without escaping\n        - 714–731: `<li><a ...>` elements insert file names directly into attributes and body without escaping\n        - 744: parent directory name construction\n        - 746–751: `{directory}`, `{parent}`, and `{files}` are inserted into the HTML template without escaping\n\n# Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Prerequisites:\n    - Directory listing is enabled using `StaticHandler`  \n      (e.g., `StaticHandler.create(\"public\").setDirectoryListing(true)`)\n    - The attacker has the ability to create arbitrary file names under a public directory (e.g., via upload functionality or a shared directory)\n\n2. Create a malicious file name (example for Unix-based OS):\n    - Create an empty file in `public/` with one of the following names:\n      - `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>.txt`\n      - Or attribute injection: `evil\" onmouseover=\"alert('XSS')\".txt`\n    - Example:\n      ```bash\n      mkdir -p public\n      printf 'test' > \"public/<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>.txt\"\n      ```\n\n3. Start the server (example):\n    - Routing: `router.route(\"/public/*\").handler(StaticHandler.create(\"public\").setDirectoryListing(true));`\n    - Server: `vertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(router).listen(8890);`\n\n4. Verification request (raw HTTP):\n    ```\n    GET /public/ HTTP/1.1\n    Host: 127.0.0.1:8890\n    Accept: text/html\n    Connection: close\n    ```\n\n5. Example response excerpt:\n    ```html\n    <ul id=\"files\">\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"/public/<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>.txt\"\n           title=\"<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>.txt\">\n           <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>.txt\n        </a>\n      </li>\n      ...\n    </ul>\n    ```\n\n- When accessing `/public/` in a browser, the unescaped file name is interpreted as HTML, and event handlers such as `onerror` are executed.\n\n# Potential Impact\n\n- **Stored XSS**\n    - Arbitrary JavaScript executes in the browser context of users viewing the listing page\n    - Possible consequences:\n        - Theft of session tokens, JWTs, localStorage contents, or CSRF tokens\n        - Unauthorized actions with admin privileges (user creation, permission changes, settings modifications)\n        - Watering hole attacks, including malware distribution or malicious script injection to other pages\n\n- **Common Conditions That Make Exploitation Easier**\n    - Uploaded files are served directly under a publicly accessible directory\n    - Shared/synced directories (e.g., NFS, SMB, WebDAV, or cloud sync) are exposed\n    - ZIP/TAR archives are extracted directly under the webroot and directory listing is enabled in production environments\n\n# Similar CVEs Previously Reported\n\n- CVE‑2024‑32966  \n- CVE‑2019‑15603",

        "Title": "Vert.x-Web Access Control Flaw in StaticHandler’s Hidden File Protection for Files Under Hidden Directories",
        "Description": "# Description\n\nThere is a flaw in the hidden file protection feature of Vert.x Web’s `StaticHandler` when `setIncludeHidden(false)` is configured.\n\nIn the current implementation, only files whose final path segment (i.e., the file name) begins with a dot (`.`) are treated as “hidden” and are blocked from being served. However, this logic fails in the following cases:\n\n- **Files under hidden directories**: For example, `/.secret/config.txt` — although `.secret` is a hidden directory, the file `config.txt` itself does not start with a dot, so it gets served.\n- **Real-world impact**: Sensitive files placed in hidden directories like `.git`, `.env`, `.aws` may become publicly accessible.\n\nAs a result, the behavior does not meet the expectations set by the `includeHidden=false` configuration, which should ideally protect all hidden files and directories. This gap may lead to unintended exposure of sensitive information.\n\n# Steps to Reproduce\n\n```bash\n1. Prepare test environment\n\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p src/test/resources/webroot/.secret\nmkdir -p src/test/resources/webroot/.git\n\n# Place test files\necho \"This is a visible file\" > src/test/resources/webroot/visible.txt\necho \"This is a hidden file\" > src/test/resources/webroot/.hidden.txt\necho \"SECRET DATA: API_KEY=abc123\" > src/test/resources/webroot/.secret/config.txt\necho \"Git config data\" > src/test/resources/webroot/.git/config\n```\n\n```java\n2. Implement test server\n\nimport io.vertx.core.AbstractVerticle;\nimport io.vertx.core.Vertx;\nimport io.vertx.ext.web.Router;\nimport io.vertx.ext.web.handler.StaticHandler;\n\npublic class StaticHandlerTestServer extends AbstractVerticle {\n  @Override\n  public void start() {\n    Router router = Router.router(vertx);\n\n    // Configure to not serve hidden files\n    StaticHandler staticHandler = StaticHandler.create(\"src/test/resources/webroot\")\n      .setIncludeHidden(false)\n      .setDirectoryListing(false);\n\n    router.route(\"/*\").handler(staticHandler);\n\n    vertx.createHttpServer()\n      .requestHandler(router)\n      .listen(8082);\n  }\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();\n    vertx.deployVerticle(new StaticHandlerTestServer());\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```bash\n3. Confirm the vulnerability\n\n# Normal file (accessible)\ncurl http://localhost:8082/visible.txt\n# Result: 200 OK\n\n# Hidden file (correctly blocked)\ncurl http://localhost:8082/.git\n# Result: 404 Not Found\n\n# File under hidden directory (vulnerable)\ncurl http://localhost:8082/.git/config\n# Result: 200 OK - Returns contents of Git config\n```\n\n# Potential Impact\n\n## 1. Information Disclosure\n\nExamples of sensitive files that could be exposed:\n\n- `.git/config`: Git repository settings (e.g., remote URL, credentials)\n- `.env/*`: Environment variables (API keys, DB credentials)\n- `.aws/credentials`: AWS access keys\n- `.ssh/known_hosts`: SSH host trust info\n- `.docker/config.json`: Docker registry credentials\n\n## 2. Attack Scenarios\n\n- Attackers can guess common hidden directory names and enumerate filenames under them to access confidential data.\n- Especially dangerous for `.git/HEAD`, `.git/config`, `.git/objects/*` — which may allow full reconstruction of source code.\n\n## 3. Affected Scope\n\n- **Affected version**: Vert.x Web 5.1.0-SNAPSHOT (likely earlier versions as well)\n- **Environments**: All OSes (Windows, Linux, macOS)\n- **Configurations**: All applications using `StaticHandler.setIncludeHidden(false)`",

        "Description": "## Summary\nA flaw in netty's parsing of chunk extensions in HTTP/1.1 messages with chunked encoding can lead to request smuggling issues with some reverse proxies.\n\n## Details\nWhen encountering a newline character (LF) while parsing a chunk extension, netty interprets the newline as the end of the chunk-size line regardless of whether a preceding carriage return (CR) was found. This is in violation of the HTTP 1.1 standard which specifies that the chunk extension is terminated by a CRLF sequence (see the [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-chunked-transfer-coding)).\n\nThis is by itself harmless, but consider an intermediary with a similar parsing flaw: while parsing a chunk extension, the intermediary interprets an LF without a preceding CR as simply part of the chunk extension (this is also in violation of the RFC, because whitespace characters are not allowed in chunk extensions). We can use this discrepancy to construct an HTTP request that the intermediary will interpret as one request but netty will interpret as two (all lines ending with CRLF, notice the LFs in the chunk extension):\n\n```\nPOST /one HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:8080\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n48;\\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\n0\n\nPOST /two HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:8080\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n0\n\n```\n\nThe intermediary will interpret this as a single request. Once forwarded to netty, netty will interpret it as two separate requests. This is a problem, because attackers can then the intermediary, as well as perform standard request smuggling attacks against other live users (see [this Portswigger article](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting)).\n\n## Impact\nThis is a request smuggling issue which can be exploited for bypassing front-end access control rules as well as corrupting the responses served to other live clients.\n\nThe impact is high, but it only affects setups that use a front-end which:\n1. Interprets LF characters (without preceding CR) in chunk extensions as part of the chunk extension.\n2. Forwards chunk extensions without normalization.\n\n## Disclosure\n\n - This vulnerability was disclosed on June 18th, 2025 here: https://w4ke.info/2025/06/18/funky-chunks.html\n\n## Discussion\nDiscussion for this vulnerability can be found here:\n - https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15522\n - https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/unCVEed/issues/1\n\n## Credit\n\n - Credit to @JeppW for uncovering this vulnerability.\n - Credit to @JLLeitschuh at [Socket](https://socket.dev/) for coordinating the vulnerability disclosure.",
